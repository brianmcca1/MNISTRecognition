Project 2 for CS4341: Intro to Artificial Intelligence

The neural network implementation can be found in `app.py`, which loads data,
creates a model, and trains the model. The decision tree implementation
can be found in `decision_tree.py` and the K nearest neighbors
implementation in `knn.py`. Both `decision_tree.py` and `knn.py` use the
`prepare_data.py` helper script to prepare data for training and
prediction.
